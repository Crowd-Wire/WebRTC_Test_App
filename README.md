# WebRTC_Test_App
This test application was made with the intent of exploring WebRTC peer-to-peer architecture. It uses a local PeerJS Server and a public Stun server from google for the communications.

In this application, it's implemented some important features, such as:

- Setting up new room calls;
- Communicate with audio and video (accessing user's media devices);
- Screen share;
- Mute both audio and video;
- Local room text chat.
